### Codesmith CSX Recursion Challenges with Solutions

Codesmith - Software Immersive Program learning platfrom CSX Challenges 

> Challenge1 : Repeater();  = Write a function that takes an input character and returns that character repeated 5 times using recursion.
> 
> Challenge2: Factorial();  = Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.
> 
> Challenge3: POW() = Write a function that takes two inputs, a base and an exponent, and returns the expected value of base ^ exponent. For instance, if our base is 2 and our exponent is 3, return 8, since: 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8.

> // Challenge4: Flow() = Write a function that takes an array of functions and a number that will be piped through all those functions. The input number passes through the first function, whose output is passed as input to the second function, whose output is passed as input to the third function, and so on. Use recursion to return the final output of the last function in the array.
